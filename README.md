# 🐚 Abalone Dataset Analysis & Age Prediction

An analytical, insight-driven data science project focused on understanding **abalone growth patterns** and **predicting age** using biological and physical measurements.

This project follows a **clean, research-oriented workflow**, combining exploratory data analysis (EDA), visual storytelling, and machine learning to ensure **clarity, interpretability, and real-world relevance**.

## ⭐ Project Overview

This case study transforms raw biological measurement data into a structured analytical narrative to examine how **size, weight, and age (rings)** are related in abalones.

The project enables analysts and researchers to explore:

- Growth patterns across physical dimensions  
- Variability in weight-based attributes  
- Age distribution of abalones  
- Relationships between size, weight, and age  
- Feasibility of predicting age using measurable biological features

## 🧠 Analytical Insights

### 🧬 Size Distribution
Length, Diameter, and Height exhibit stable and centrally distributed patterns, indicating consistent biological growth across the abalone population.

### 🐚 Weight Variability
Weight-based features (Whole, Shucked, Viscera, Shell weight) show higher variability, suggesting that abalones of similar size can differ substantially in mass due to age and biological factors.

### 🔗 Age Correlation
Whole Weight demonstrates a strong positive correlation with Rings (age), making it the most influential predictor for age estimation.

### 🧓 Age Group Distribution
Most abalones fall within mid-range age groups, indicating a mature and balanced population rather than dominance of juvenile or aged specimens.

### 📊 Growth Trends
An increase in size and weight corresponds to an increase in ring count, validating expected biological growth-age relationships.

## 🤖 Machine Learning & Model Evaluation

Two regression models were trained and evaluated using an 80–20 train-test split.

### 🔹 Linear Regression (Baseline Model)
- **MAE:** 1.64 years  
- **RMSE:** 2.25 years  
- **R² Score:** 0.50  

Captures general linear relationships and serves as a strong baseline.

### 🔹 Random Forest Regressor (Best Model)
- **MAE:** 1.57 years  
- **RMSE:** 2.19 years  
- **R² Score:** 0.53  
- **Pseudo Accuracy:** **83.97%**

Random Forest outperforms Linear Regression by modeling **non-linear biological growth patterns**, resulting in improved accuracy and reliability.

> *Pseudo Accuracy represents the percentage of predictions within an acceptable error tolerance and is used as an intuitive complement to standard regression metrics.*

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

Abalone age can be effectively inferred from physical and weight-based measurements.  
**Whole Weight emerges as the strongest predictor**, and ensemble learning (Random Forest) provides superior predictive performance—forming a strong foundation for practical age estimation models.
